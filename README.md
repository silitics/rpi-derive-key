    RPi Derive Key 🔑

<h4 align="center">
    A utility for deriving secure device-specific keys on Raspberry Pi.
</h4>

⚠️ **Caution:** This tool is based on storing a randomly generated _device secret_ in the [_One-Time Programmable_ (OTP) memory](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#otp-register-and-bit-definitions) of the Raspberry Pi SoC. The initialization of this secret is **irreversible**. Please **make sure you understand the provided security guarantees** before using it for anything serious.

- **Cryptographically strong** key derivation using [SHA3-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) and [HKDF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869).
- Statically-linked **standalone binary** with zero dependencies.
- [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/rpi-derive-key) and [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-derive-key/) for easy integration into your project.

#### How does it work?

Upon initialization, a randomly generated 256-bit _device secret_ is stored in the OTP memory of the Raspberry Pi SoC. Note that the OTP memory on any board can be programmed _only once_. This secret is then used as input key material for the HKDF key derivation algorithm using SHA3-512 as the hash function. This enables the derivation of multiple keys from the device secret. Each key is derived from the derive secret and additional _info_ material (see HKDF). The device secret should be kept secret and `rpi-derive-key` does not provide any means of reading it directly. Using it and the info material, any key can be reconstructed. Note that the Raspberry Pi SoC does _not_ provide a hardware-protected store for the secret. Any user in the `video` group and anyone with physical access to the board can obtain the secret (unless secure boot is used). Via [secure boot](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/blob/master/secure-boot-example/README.md) it is indeed possible to prevent any unauthorized access when deploying Raspberry Pi's in untrusted environments.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### Initialization of the Device Secret

Irreversibly initialize the device secret:

```
rpi-derive-key init
```

The initialization may fail if the firmware does not support storing a private key in OTP memory. You may need to update the firmware or use the generic customer-programable OTP registers instead with:

```
rpi-derive-key --customer-otp init
```

### Deriving a Key

To derive a key use

```
rpi-derive-key gen <BYTES> <INFO>
```

where `<BYTES>` is the key size in bytes and `<INFO>` is some arbitrary string.

For instance:

```
rpi-derive-key gen 32 fs.root.encryption
```

By using different values for `<INFO>` you can generate multiple independent keys.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you would like to derive a unique public ID and a secret identification token for each device.

You can derive a _Universally Unique Identifier_ ([UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)), using `device.id` as info material, with:

```
rpi-derive-key uuid device.id
```

You can now safely use the resulting UUID as a public device identifier. You do not have to keep it secret because it is impossible to reconstruct other keys or the device secret from it.

In addition to the public id, you can generate a 256-bit secret token with:

```
rpi-derive-key hex 32 device.secret.token
```

This secret token is supposed to be shared only with trustworthy entities, e.g., it may be sent in HTTP headers to prove the device's identity to a webserver providing device configurations:

```
wget --header "X-Secret-Token: <SECRET-TOKEN>" https://example.com/<DEVICE-ID>/config.tar.gz
```

📌 **Tip:** You should use different keys (with different info material) for different purposes. That way, if a key for a given purpose is compromised, all other keys remain secure.
