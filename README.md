    RPi Derive Key üîë

<h4 align="center">
    A utility for deriving secure device-specific keys on Raspberry Pi.
</h4>

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** This tool is based on storing a randomly generated _device secret_ in the [_One-Time Programmable_ (OTP) memory](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#otp-register-and-bit-definitions) of the Raspberry Pi SoC. The initialization of this secret is **irreversible**. Please **make sure you understand the provided security guarantees** before using it for anything serious.

- **Cryptographically strong** key derivation using [SHA3-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) and [HKDF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869).
- Statically-linked **standalone binary** with zero dependencies.
- Rust crate and Python package for easy integration in your project.

## Usage

### Initialization of the Device Secret

Irreversibly initialize the device secret:

```
rpi-derive-key init
```

The initialization may fail if the firmware does not support storing a private key in OTP memory. You may need to update the firmware or use the generic customer-programable OTP registers instead with:

```
rpi-derive-key --customer-otp init
```

### Deriving a Key

To derive a key use

```
rpi-derive-key gen <BYTES> <INFO>
```

where `<BYTES>` is the key size in bytes and `<INFO>` is some arbitrary string.

For instance:

```
rpi-derive-key gen 32 fs.root.encryption
```

By using different values for `<INFO>` you can generate multiple independent keys.

## ü§î How it Works

Upon initialization, a randomly generated 256-bit secret is stored in the OTP memory. This key is used as input key material for the HKDF key derivation algorithm.
