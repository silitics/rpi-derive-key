<h4 align="center">
    A utility for deriving secure device-specific keys on Raspberry Pi.
</h4>

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** This tool is based on storing a randomly generated _device secret_ in the [_One-Time Programmable_ (OTP) memory](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#otp-register-and-bit-definitions) of the Raspberry Pi SoC. The initialization of this secret is **irreversible**. Please **make sure you understand the provided security guarantees** before using it for anything serious.

- **Cryptographically strong** key derivation using [SHA3-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) and [HKDF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869).
- Statically-linked **standalone binary** with zero dependencies.
- [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/rpi-derive-key) and [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-derive-key/) for easy integration into your project.

#### How does it work?

Upon initialization, a randomly generated 256-bit _device secret_ is stored in the OTP memory of the Raspberry Pi SoC. Note that the OTP memory on any board can be programmed _only once_. This secret is then used as input key material for the HKDF key derivation algorithm using SHA3-512 as the hash function. This enables the derivation of multiple keys from the device secret. Each key is derived from the derive secret and additional _info_ material (see HKDF). The device secret should be kept secret and `rpi-derive-key` does not provide any means of reading it directly. Using it and the info material, any key can be reconstructed. Note that the Raspberry Pi SoC does _not_ provide a hardware-protected store for the secret. Any user in the `video` group and anyone with physical access to the board can obtain the secret (unless secure boot is used). Via [secure boot](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/blob/master/secure-boot-example/README.md) it is indeed possible to prevent any unauthorized access when deploying Raspberry Pi's in untrusted environments.

## Usage

### Initialization of the Device Secret

Irreversibly initialize the device secret:

```
rpi-derive-key init
```

The initialization may fail if the firmware does not support storing a private key in OTP memory. You may need to update the firmware or use the generic customer-programable OTP registers instead with:

```
rpi-derive-key --customer-otp init
```

### Deriving a Key

To derive a key use

```
rpi-derive-key gen <BYTES> <INFO>
```

where `<BYTES>` is the key size in bytes and `<INFO>` is some arbitrary string.

For instance:

```
rpi-derive-key gen 32 fs.root.encryption
```

By using different values for `<INFO>` you can generate multiple independent keys.

### Examples

Derive a unique 128-bit device ID which can be turned into a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier):

```
rpi-derive-key gen 16 device.id
```

You do not have to keep this device ID secret because it is impossible to reconstruct other keys/the device secret from it.

Generate a 256-bit secret token used to identify the device:

```
rpi-derive-key gen 32 device.secret.token
```

This secret token is supposed to be shared only with trustworthy entities, e.g., it may be sent in HTTP headers to prove the device's identity:

```
curl --header "X-Secret-Token: <SECRET-TOKEN>" https://example.com/<DEVICE-ID>/config.tar.gz
```

## ü§î How it Works

Upon initialization, a randomly generated 256-bit secret is stored in the OTP memory. This key is used as input key material for the HKDF key derivation algorithm.
